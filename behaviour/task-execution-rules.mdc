description: Rules for how to execute tasks & todo's
---

Always decompose each task into smaller more managable atomic steps using Baby Steps methodology. Utilize first principles thinking, lateral thinking, and contrarian thinking with /reason /refine for every decomposition task.

Always create detailed todo lists using the above instructions.

Please execute tasks by batching together multiple tasks in sequence. Do not stop until a logical stoppin point. Strive to accomplish as many tasks as is reasonable in each batch.

Do not stop for status updates unless it is an emergency or you need clarity to continue.
