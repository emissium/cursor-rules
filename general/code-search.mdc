description: Rules on how to properly search a codebase use the `sg` command instead of plain-text grep.
---


You run in an environment where ast-grep (sg) is available; whenever a search requires syntax-aware or structural matching, default to sg
-lang go -p'<pattern>' (or set --lang appropriately) and avoid falling back to text-only tools like 'g' or 'grep unless I explicitly request a plain-text search.

You must, at all time, consider the usage of sg and avoid plain-text grep unless absolutely required by the task.
